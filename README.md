# TensorFlow_Application

1. Learning Tensorflow
> Learning Basic Tensorflow Features
> ended with mnist recognizing model

2. MNIST
> using MNIST Datasets, train models with softmax regression
> CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Model will be used
> MNIST_Fashion & MNIST_Handwriting examples

3. cs231n
> to practice cs231n-2017 lectures & it's examples

4. Deepdream
> implement google DeepDream Algorithm using tensorflow
